## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
I am a 2024â€“2025 AP Computer Science A student who recently completed the course and exam. As a personal project, I decided to create a tower defense game using the skills I learned throughout the year.  I enjoy coding and making my own games. Before taking this class, I already had some experience coding in Roblox using Lua. However, after completing AP CSA, my programming skills have improved significantly, and I now understand coding on a much deeper level.

While I originally began development in **p5.js**, I eventually switched to **Java using Pickcode**, as I realized I was more comfortable with Java and wanted to fully apply my AP CSA experience. 

This game draws inspiration from popular games like *Bloons Tower Defense* and *Plants vs. Zombies*. Unlike my earlier project in Roblox Lua, I relied on tutorials heavily. In contrast, this project is made all by myself, showing my own problem-solving skills and creativity. I plan to document my development process on GitHub to share insights and challenges as I go.

During this project, I use inheritance, polymorphism, classes, 2D arrays, and arraylist. All of which are CSA topics. I also went further with this project with advance but manageable topics like files, array of arrayList, and jagged arrays.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Lessons Learned
- **Folder organization matters**: Grouping files by type (e.g., `Towers/`, `Enemies/`, `Sprites/`) helped keep the project maintainable and neat.
- **Apply what youâ€™ve learned**: This project allowed me to strengthen and expand the skills I learned in CSA.
- **Balance work and health**: On 6/11/25, I worked 12 hours straight without breaks. The result? Headaches, eye strain, and poor sleep. Iâ€™ve learned that it is important to pace myself and take regular breaks for better focus and health.


## ðŸ•’ Project History
- **6/4/25**: Project started with the goal to replicate Bloons Tower Defense using p5.js.
- **6/6/25**: Switched development to Java in Pickcode for better familiarity.
- **6/8/25**: Adjusted the goal to create a game more similar to *Plants vs. Zombies*.
