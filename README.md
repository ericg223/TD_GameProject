## 📘 Introduction
I am a 2024–2025 AP Computer Science A student who recently completed the course and exam. As a personal project, I decided to create a tower defense game using the skills I learned throughout the year.  I enjoy coding and making my own games. Before taking this class, I already had some experience coding in Roblox using Lua. However, after completing AP CSA, my programming skills have improved significantly, and I now understand coding on a much deeper level.

While I originally began development in **p5.js**, I eventually switched to **Java using Pickcode**, as I realized I was more comfortable with Java and wanted to fully apply my AP CSA experience. 

This game draws inspiration from popular games like *Bloons Tower Defense* and *Plants vs. Zombies*. Unlike my earlier project in Roblox Lua, I relied on tutorials heavily. In contrast, this project is made all by myself, showing my own problem-solving skills and creativity. I plan to document my development process on GitHub to share insights and challenges as I go.

During this project, I use inheritance, polymorphism, classes, 2D arrays, and arraylist. All of which are CSA topics. I also went further with this project with advance but manageable topics like files, array of arrayList, and jagged arrays.

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned
- **Folder organization matters**: Grouping files by type (e.g., `Towers/`, `Enemies/`, `Sprites/`) helped keep the project maintainable and neat.
- **Apply what you’ve learned**: This project allowed me to strengthen and expand the skills I learned in CSA.
- **Balance work and health**: On 6/11/25, I worked 12 hours straight without breaks. The result? Headaches, eye strain, and poor sleep. I’ve learned that it is important to pace myself and take regular breaks for better focus and health.


## 🕒 Project History
- **6/4/25**: Project started with the goal to replicate Bloons Tower Defense using p5.js.
- **6/6/25**: Switched development to Java in Pickcode for better familiarity.
- **6/8/25**: Adjusted the goal to create a game more similar to *Plants vs. Zombies*.
