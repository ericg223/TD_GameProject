## Tower
### Summary

To create a tower defense game, we need characters (or towers) that can attack enemies. I designed my own sprites using reference images and Piskel App. My goal for this project is to implement six unique towers to defend the base. Each tower will have its own custom sprite and a distinct attack mechanic.

## Towers
| Done | Task |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ✅ | Cannon (Damage enemy)|
| ✅ | Freezer (Apply cold effect to enemy and make them walk slower)|
| ✅ | Mythic Cannon (Stronger cannon)|
| ✅ | DJ (Play music and buff the firerate of nearby towers)|
| ✅ | Farm (Gives money every few second)|
| ✅ | Stone Head (Helps stall the enemy)|

## Challenges
- After making a few sprites, I realize that while making sprites resolution and pixels matters. I had to redo some models to make sure it has the right amount of pixels.
- One major challenge I face was trying to figure out how to rotate the tower to face the enemy each time. It was very hard to do because there wasn't a specific method that will do this. There is a rotate method but it rotates the whole board, which is not useful. (In the end, I decided to change the project focus to making a game similar to plant vs zombie instead of bloons tower defense)
